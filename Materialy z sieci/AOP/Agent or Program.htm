The advent of software agents gave rise to much discussion of just what
such an agent is, and of how they differ from programs in general. Here
we propose a <!-- Anchor Link Tag --><a href="#agent">formal definition
of an autonomous agent</a> which clearly distinguishes a software agent
from just any program. We also offer the beginnings of a <!-- Anchor Link Tag --><a href="#taxonomy">natural
kinds taxonomy</a> of autonomous agents, and discuss possibilities for further
<!-- Anchor Link Tag --><a href="#classifications">classification</a>. Finally,
we discuss <!-- Anchor Link Tag --><a href="#subagents">subagents and multiagent
systems</a>.
<h3>Introduction</h3>
On meeting a friend or colleague that we haven't seen for a while, or a
new acquaintance, some version of the following conversation often ensues:
<br>
<br>
<i>What are you working on these days?<br>
Control structures for autonomous agents.<br>
Autonomous agents? What do you mean by that?<br>
<br>
</i>A brief explanation is then followed by:<br>
<br>
<i>But agents sound just like computer programs. How are they different?</i><br>
<br>
This elicits a more satisfying explanation that distinguishes between agent
and program. The nature of this "more satisfying explanation"
motivates this essay. After a <!-- Anchor Link Tag --><a href="#defs">review</a>
of some of the many ways the term "agent" has been used within
the context of autonomous agents, we'll propose and defend a <!-- Anchor Link Tag --><a href="#agent">notion
of agent</a> that is clearly distinct from a program. This discussion will
lead us to a discussion of possible <!-- Anchor Link Tag --><a href="#classifications">classifications
for autonomous agents</a>.
<h3><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><a name="defs"></a>What is an agent?</h3>
Workers involved in agent research have offered a variety of definitions,
each hoping to explicate his or her use of the word "agent." These
definitions range from the simple to the lengthy and demanding. We suspect
that each of them grew directly out of the set of examples of agents that
the definer had in mind. (This is certainly the case for the version we'll
propose below.) Let's orient ourselves by examining and comparing some of
these definitions.<br>
<br>
<b>The MuBot Agent</b> [<!-- Link Tag --><a href="http://www.crystaliz.com/logicware/mubot.html">http://www.crystaliz.com/logicware/mubot.html</a>]
<i>"The term agent is used to represent two orthogonal concepts. The
first is the agent's ability for autonomous execution. The second is the
agent's ability to perform domain oriented reasoning."</i>P&gt; This
pointer at definitions come from an online white paper by Sankar Virdhagriswaran
of Crystaliz, Inc., defining mobile agent technology. Autonomous execution
is clearly central to agency. <br>
<br>
<b>The AIMA Agent</b> [Russell and Norvig 1995, page 33]<i> "An agent
is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors
and acting upon that environment through effectors." </i><br>
<br>
AIMA is an acronym for "Artificial Intelligence: a Modern Approach,"
a remarkably successful new AI text that was used in 200 colleges and universities
in 1995. The authors were interested in software agents embodying AI techniques.
Clearly, the AIMA definition depends heavily on what we take as the environment,
and on what sensing and acting mean. If we define the environment as whatever
provides input and receives output, and take receiving input to be sensing
and producing output to be acting, every program is an agent. Thus, if we
want to arrive at a useful contrast between agent and program, we must restrict
at least some of the notions of environment, sensing and acting.<br>
<br>
<b>The Maes Agent</b> [Maes 1995, page 108]<i> "Autonomous agents are
computational systems that inhabit some complex dynamic environment, sense
and act autonomously in this environment, and by doing so realize a set
of goals or tasks for which they are designed." </i><br>
<br>
Pattie Maes, of MIT's Media Lab, is one of the pioneers of agent research.
She adds a crucial element to her definition of an agent: agents must act
autonomously so as to "realize a set of goals." Also environments
are restricted to being complex and dynamic. It's not clear whether this
rules out a payroll program without further restrictions.<br>
<br>
<b>The KidSim Agent</b> [Smith, Cypher and Spohrer 1994]<i> "Let us
define an agent as a persistent software entity dedicated to a specific
purpose. 'Persistent' distinguishes agents from subroutines; agents have
their own ideas about how to accomplish tasks, their own agendas. 'Special
purpose' distinguishes them from entire multifunction applications; agents
are typically much smaller."</i><br>
<br>
The authors are with Apple. The explicit requirement of persistence is a
new and important addition here. Though many agents are "special purpose"
we suspect this is not an essential feature of agency. <br>
<br>
<b>The Hayes-Roth Agent</b> [Hayes-Roth 1995]<i> Intelligent agents continuously
perform three functions: perception of dynamic conditions in the environment;
action to affect conditions in the environment; and reasoning to interpret
perceptions, solve problems, draw inferences, and determine actions.</i><br>
<br>
Barbara Hayes-Roth of Stanford's Knowledge Systems Laboratory insists that
agents reason during the process of action selection. If reasoning is interpreted
broadly, her agent architecture does allow for reflex actions as well as
planned actions.<br>
<br>
<b>The IBM Agent </b>[<!-- Link Tag --><a href="http://activist.gpl.ibm.com:81/WhitePaper/ptc2.htm">http://activist.gpl.ibm.com:81/WhitePaper/ptc2.htm</a>]<i>
"Intelligent agents are software entities that carry out some set of
operations on behalf of a user or another program with some degree of independence
or autonomy, and in so doing, employ some knowledge or representation of
the user's goals or desires."</i><br>
<br>
This definition, from IBM's Intelligent Agent Strategy white paper, views
an intelligent agent as acting for another, with authority granted by the
other. A typical example might be an information gathering agent, though
the white paper talks of eight possible applications. Would you stretch
"some degree of independence" to include a payroll program? What
if it called itself on a certain day of the month? <br>
<br>
<b>The Wooldridge計;Jennings Agent</b> [Wooldridge and Jennings 1995,
page 2] <i>"... a hardware or (more usually) software-based computer
system that enjoys the following properties: </i>
<ul>
  <li><i><!-- List Tag -->autonomy: agents operate without the direct intervention
of humans or others, and have some kind of control over their actions and
internal state;</i> 
  </li><li><i>social ability: agents interact with other agents (and possibly
humans) via some kind of agent-communication language;</i> 
  </li><li><i>reactivity: agents perceive their environment, (which may be the
physical world, a user via a graphical user interface, a collection of other
agents, the INTERNET, or perhaps all of these combined), and respond in
a timely fashion to changes that occur in it;</i> 
  </li><li><i>pro-activeness: agents do not simply act in response to their environment,
they are able to exhibit goal-directed behavour by taking the initiative."
</i>
</li></ul>
The Wooldridge and Jennings definition, in addition to spelling out autonomy,
sensing and acting, allows for a broad, but finite, range of environments.
They further add a communications requirement. What would be the status
of a payroll program with a graphical interface and a decidedly primitive
communication language?<br>
<br>
<b>The SodaBot Agent</b> [Michael Coen <!-- Link Tag --><a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/sodabot/slideshow/total/P001.html">http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/sodabot/slideshow/total/P001.html</a>]
<i>"Software agents are programs that engage in dialogs [and] negotiate
and coordinate transfer of information."</i> <br>
<br>
SodaBot is a development environment for software agent being constructed
at the MIT AI Lab by Michael Coen. Note the apparently almost empty intersection
between this definition and the preceding seven. we say "apparently"
since negotiating, for example, requires both sensing and acting. And dialoging
requires communication. Still the feeling of this definition is vastly different
from the first few, and would seem to rule out almost all standard programs.<br>
<br>
<b>The Foner Agent</b> [Lenny Foner - Download from <!-- Link Tag --><a href="ftp://media.mit.edu/pub/Foner/Papers/Julia/Agents--Julia.ps">ftp://media.mit.edu/pub/Foner/Papers/Julia/Agents--Julia.ps</a>
or online at<br>
<!-- Link Tag --><a href="http://foner.www.media.mit.edu/people/foner/Julia/">http://foner.www.media.mit.edu/people/foner/Julia/</a>
(click on "What's an agent? Crucial notions")] <br>
<br>
Foner requires much more of an agent. His agents collaborate with their
users to improve the accomplishment of the users' tasks. This requires,
in addition to autonomy, that the agent dialog with the user, be trustworthy,
and degrade gracefully in the face of a "communications mismatch."
However, this quick paraphrase doesn't do justice to Foner's analysis. <br>
<br>
<b>The Brustoloni Agent</b> [Brustoloni 1991, Franklin 1995, p. 265] <i>"Autonomous
agents are systems capable of autonomous, purposeful action in the real
world."</i><br>
<br>
The Brustoloni agent, unlike the prior agents, must live and act "in
the real world." This definition excludes software agents and programs
in general. Brustoloni also insists that his agents be "reactive 計;
that is, be able to respond to external, asynchronous stimuli in a timely
fashion."<br>
<br>
As these definitions make clear, there's no general agreement as to what
constitutes an agent, or as to how agents differ from programs. The Software
Agents Mailing List on the Internet provides a FAQ (frequently asked questions)
that says,<br>
<br>
<b>The FAQ Agent</b> [<!-- Link Tag --><a href="http://www.ee.mcgill.ca/%7Ebelmarc/agent_faq.html">http://www.ee.mcgill.ca:80/~belmarc/agent_faq.html</a>]
<i>"This FAQ will not attempt to provide an authoritative definition
..."</i> <br>
<br>
It does provide a list of attributes often found in agents: Autonomous,
goal-oriented, collaborative, flexible, self-starting, temporal continuity,
character, communicative, adaptive, mobile, [Etzioni and Weld]. Several
of these would seem to rule out our payroll program. 
<h3><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><a name="agent"></a>The Essence of Agency</h3>
We normally avoid prescriptive arguments about how a word should be used.
Russell and Norvig put it this way: "The notion of an agent is meant
to be a tool for analyzing systems, not an absolute characterization that
divides the world into agents and non-agents." [1995, page 33] The
only concepts that yield sharp edge categories are mathematical concepts,
and they succeed only because they are content free. Agents "live"
in the real world (or some world), and real world concepts yield fuzzy categories.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, we will propose a mathematical style definition of an autonomous
agent, knowing full well that it must fail around the edges. Our definition
attempts to capture the essence of being an agent, and to define the broadest
class of agents. Further restrictions can then be added to define more particular
classes of agents. Ideally, such an endeavor would produce a nomenclature
of agents that could be used relatively unambiguously by researchers in
the field, resulting in clearer communications.<br>
<br>
The definitions of the previous section seem to derive from one or both
of two common uses of the word agent: 1) one who acts, or who can act, and
2) one who acts in place of another with permission. Since "one who
acts in place of " acts, the second usage requires the first. Hence,
let's go for a definition of the first notion.<br>
<br>
What are examples of agents in this first sense upon which we can build
our mathematical style definition? Well, humans act, as do most other animals.
(I say most since some animals act during a portion of their lives and not
during others, for example the sea squirt [Dethie 1986].) Also, some autonomous
mobile robots act, for example Brooks' Herbert [Brooks 1990, p. 8; Franklin
1995, p263-5]. All of these are real world agents. Software agents "live"
in computer operating systems, databases, networks, MUDs, etc. Almost all
the definitions in the previous section refer to software agents. Finally,
artificial life agents "live" in artificial environments on a
computer screen or in its memory [Langton 1989, Franklin 1995, pp. 185-208].
What do these agents share that constitutes the essence of being an agent?
<br>
<br>
Each is situated in, and is a part on some environment. Each senses its
environment and act autonomously upon it. No other entity is required to
feed it input, or to interpret and use its output. Each acts in pursuit
of it's own agenda, whether satisfying evolved drives as in humans and animals,
or pursuing goals designed in by some other agent, as in software agents.
(Artificial life agents may be of either variety.) Each acts so that its
current actions may effect its later sensing, that is its actions effect
its environment. Finally, each acts continually over some period of time.
A software agent, once invoked, typically runs until it decides not to.
An artificial life agent often runs until it's eaten or otherwise dies.
Of course, some human can pull the plug, but not always. Mobile agents on
the Internet may be beyond calling back by the user.<br>
<br>
To us, these requirements constitute the essence of being an agent. Let's
formalize them into a definition.<br>
<br>
<em>An <b>autonomous agent</b> is a system situated within and a part of
an environment that senses that environment and acts on it, over time, in
pursuit of its own agenda and so as to effect what it senses in the future.</em><br>
<br>
One way of clarifying the boundaries of this definition is by looking at
extreme cases. Humans and some animals are at the high end of being an agent,
with multiple, conflicting drives, multiples senses, multiple possible actions,
and complex sophisticated control structures (minds [Franklin 1995]) . At
the low end, with one or two senses, a single action, and an absurdly simple
control structure (mind?) we find a thermostat. A thermostat? Yes, a thermostat
satisfies all the requirements of the definition, as does a bacterium. Strange
things sometimes happen at the extremes. Espousing a definition entails
these risks.<br>
<br>
Our definition yields a large and varied class of agents as was to be expected
of one requiring only the essence. No doubt it's too large to be useful
as is. Adding additional requirements for different purposes will produce
useful subclasses of agents. We'll discuss some of these in the next section.
But first, there are a couple of basic points to clarify.<br>
<br>
Autonomous agents are situated in some environment. Change the environment
and we may no longer have an agent. A robot with only visual sensors in
an environment without light is not an agent. Systems are agents or not
with respect to some environment. The AIMA agent discussed above requires
that an agent "can be viewed" as sensing and acting in an environment,
that is, there must exist an environment in which it is an agent.<br>
<br>
What about ordinary programs? A payroll program in a real world environment
could be said to sense the world via it's input and act on it via its output,
but is not an agent because its output would not normally effect what it
senses later. A payroll program also fails the "over time" test
of temporal continuity. It runs once and then goes into a coma, waiting
to be called again. Most ordinary programs are ruled out by one or both
of these conditions, regardless of how we stretch to define a suitable environment.
All software agents are programs, but not all programs are agents.<br>
<br>
Nor are software agents defined by their tasks. A spell checker adjunct
to a wordprocessor is typically not an agent for the reasons given in the
preceding paragraph. However, a spell checker that watched as I typed and
corrected on the fly might well be an agent. Tasks can be specified so as
to require agents to fulfill them.<br>
<br>
Subroutines of agents need not be agents for the same reasons that programs
need not be. However agents can have subagents. Herbert, the robot mentioned
above, is built using a subsumption architecture [Brooks 1990], a layered
architecture in which each layer senses and acts in order to perform its
task. Each layer satisfies all the requirements of an autonomous agent.
Thus the layers constitute a multiagent system that controls Herbert. Sumpy
[Song, Franklin and Negatu, 1996] is a software agent living in a unix file
system. Sumpy, also built using subsumption architecture, consists of subagents
that wander, that compress files, that backup files, and that put Sumpy
to sleep when the system is busy. Thus, Sumpy is both an agent and a multiagent
system.<br>
<br>
Our definition of an autonomous agents has succeeded in distinguishing between
agents and programs. An agent need not be a program at all; it may be a
robot or a school teacher. Software agents are, by definition, programs,
but a program must measure up to several marks to be an agent. But our definition
of autonomous agents yield a class of agents so large as not to promise
great utility. Let's look at subclasses of agents with more promise.
<h3>Agent Classifications</h3>
The various definitions discussed above involve a host of properties of
an agent. Having settled on a much less restrictive definition of an autonomous
agent, these properties may help us further classify agents in useful ways.
The table that follows lists several of the properties mentioned above.<br>
<br>
<!-- Table Tag --><table> <tbody><tr><td><b>Property</b></td><td><b>Other Names</b></td><td><b>Meaning</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>reactive</td><td>(sensing and acting)</td><td>responds in a timely
fashion to changes in the environment</td></tr> <tr><td>autonomous</td><td></td><td>exercises
control over its own actions </td></tr> <tr><td>goal-oriented</td><td>pro-active
purposeful </td><td>does not simply act in response to the environment</td></tr>
<tr><td>temporally continuous</td><td></td><td>is a continuously running
process</td></tr> <tr><td>communicative</td><td>socially able </td><td>communicates
with other agents, perhaps including people</td></tr> <tr><td>learning</td><td>adaptive</td><td>changes
its behavior based on its previous experience</td></tr> <tr><td>mobile</td><td></td><td>able
to transport itself from one machine to another</td></tr> <tr><td>flexible</td><td></td><td>actions
are not scripted</td></tr> <tr><td>character</td><td></td><td>believable
"personality" and emotional state.</td></tr> </tbody></table><br>
Agents may be usefully classified according to the subset of these properties
that they enjoy. Every agent, by our definition, satisfies the first four
properties. Adding other properties produces potentially useful classes
of agents, for example, mobile, learning agents. Thus a hierarchical classification
based on set inclusion occurs naturally. Mobile, learning agents are then
a subclass of mobile agents. <br>
<br>
There are, of course, other possible classifying schemes. For example, we
might classify software agents according to the tasks they perform, for
example, information gathering agents or email filtering agents. Or, we
might classify them according to their control architecture. Sumpy, then,
would be a fuzzy subsumption agent, while Etzioni and Weld's Softbot would
be a planning agent [1994]. Agents may also be classified by the range and
sensitivity of their senses, or by the range and effectiveness of their
actions, or by how much internal state they possess.<br>
<br>
Brustoloni's taxonomy of software agents [1991] begins with a three-way
classification into regulation agents, planning agents, or adaptive agents.
A regulation agent, probably named with regulation of temperature by a thermostat
or similar regulation of bodily homeostasis, reacts to each sensory input
as it comes in, and always knows what to do. It neither plans nor learns.
Planning agents plan, either in the usual AI sense (problem solving agent),
or using the case-based paradigm (case-based agents), or using operations
research based methods (OR agents), or using various randomizing algorithms
(randomizing agent). Brustoloni's adaptive agents not only plan, but learn.
Thus there are adaptive problem solving agents, and so on, yielding a two
layer taxonomy.<br>
<br>
Yet another possible classification scheme might involve the environment
in which the agent finds itself, for example software agents as opposed
to artificial life agents. And, there must be many, many more such possibilities.
Which one, or ones, shall we choose?
<h3><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><a name="taxonomy"></a>A Natural Kinds Taxonomy
of Agents</h3>
In thinking about a taxonomy of agents two possible models come to mind,
the biological model and the mathematical model. The biological taxonomy
takes the form of a tree with "living creatures" at the root and
individual species at the leaves. For example, we humans are classified
as 
<ul>
  <li><!-- List Tag -->kingdom - animal 
  </li><li>phylum - chordata 
  </li><li>class - mammalia 
  </li><li>order - primate 
  </li><li>family - pongidae 
  </li><li>subfamily - hominidae 
  </li><li>genus - homo 
  </li><li>species - sapiens 
</li></ul>
where each line represents a branching point of the tree. Might it be possible
to create such a taxonomy of autonomous agents? Let's start and see where
we get.<br>
<br>
At the kingdom level let's classify our agents as either biological, robotic,
or computational, as these seem to be natural kinds [Keil, (1989)]. Every
culture and even very young children readily distinguish between animate
organisms, artifacts and abstract concepts. At the phylum level we can reasonably
subclassify computational into software agents and artificial life agents.
At the class level we might subclassify software agents into task-specific
agents (like Sumpy), entertainment agents (like Julia), and computer viruses.
At this point we've succeeded in categorizing our major classes of autonomous
agents, that is the known families of examples.<br>
<br>
<!-- Graphic Tag --><img src="Agent%20or%20Program_pliki/agentprog.GIF" naturalsizeflag="0" align="BOTTOM" border="3" height="251" width="464"> 
<h3><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><a name="classifications"></a>Further Classification</h3>
Suppose we wished to classify software agents further. How might we go about
it? The major subclassification schemes that come to mind are via control
structures, via environments (database, file system, network, Internet),
via language (in which written) or via applications. Each might be useful.
Let's try the first.<br>
<br>
Let's list some of the possible initial classification schemes for software
agents via their control structures. Brustoloni offers regulation, planning
and adaptive. Another strategy would be to classify by type of control mechanism,
algorithmic, rule-based, planner, fuzzy, neural net, machine learning, etc.
Or we might distinguish agents with a central executive from those enjoying
distributed control. Other binary classifications might be planning vs.
non-planning, learning vs. non-learning, mobile vs. non-mobile, communicative
vs. non- communicative, etc. <br>
<br>
Suppose we used the binary classification above, including central vs. distributed,
in the order mentioned, to create a binary classification tree. The first
branching would be according to the first pair. On each of these branches
we then branch according to the second pair, and on each of these four we
branch again via the third pair, and so on. We've essentially listed a pool
of features and classified according to subsets of these features. <br>
<br>
Viewing our taxonomic tree from this perspective calls to mind a mathematical
taxonomy which also employs collections of properties. A mathematician might
define a topological space (please don't bother yourself about the meanings
of this mathematical term or others). This essential definition defines
the class of spaces to be studied. Then the notion of a Hausdorff space
might be defined by an explicit property of some spaces. Thus the subclass
of Hausdorff spaces is specified. Next the notion of a compact space may
be defined, yielding the subclass of compact spaces. The intersection of
these two is the subclass of compact Hausdorff spaces, about which theorems
are often proved. The topological classification continues in this way with
defining properties giving rise to subclasses of spaces which are then studied.<br>
<br>
This type of classification scheme is known as a matrix organization among
psychologists. Each feature defines a dimension. With n features an n-dimensional
matrix is created, so that each cell of the matrix corresponds to a collection
of features, and provides one possible category for the classification.<br>
<br>
Having given the essential definition of an autonomous agent above, the
class of agent is specified. We may then speak of planning agents, or of
mobile agents, or even of mobile, communicative, planning agents, each specifying
a subclass of agents. Of course, we must have given definitions of these
three properties. Having the basic definition of an autonomous agent to
build on, and using features for further classification, we may rephrase
some of the definitions given earlier in a more convenient manner:
<ul>
  <li><!-- List Tag -->A <i>KidSim Agent</i> is dedicated to a specific
purpose, i.e., is a task-specific agent. 
  </li><li><br>
  </li><li>A<i> Hayes-Roth Agent</i> reasons to interpret perceptions, solve
problems, draw inferences, and determine actions, i.e., is a reasoning agent.
  </li><li><br>
  </li><li>An <i>IBM Agent</i> carries out some set of operations on behalf of
a user or another program, i.e., is a task-specific agent. 
  </li><li><br>
  </li><li>A <i>Wooldridge計;Jennings</i> Agent interacts with other agents
(and possibly humans) via some kind of agent-communication language, i.e.,
is a communicative agent. 
  </li><li><br>
  </li><li>A <i>SodaBot Agent</i> engages in dialog , and negotiates and coordinates
transfer of information, i.e., is a negotiating, information agent. 
</li></ul>
<h3><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><a name="subagents"></a>Subagents and Societies
of Agents</h3>
Sumpy, the file system maintenance agent mentioned above, can be thought
of as a single agent, or as a multiagent system consisting of Wanderer,
Compressor, Back-Up and Sleepy. Each of these have independent access to
sensors (certain unix commands such as ls) and to actions (other unix commands
such as cd), and each has its own simple agenda. Also, each runs continuously,
and acts so as to effect its next sensing. Thus, each may be considered
an agent in it's own right, and hence a subagent. Sumpy is thus a multiagent
system.<br>
<br>
Some agents with a layered architecture are not multiagent systems. Mller,
Pischel, and Thiel (1995) classify such architectures into vertically and
horizontally layered. In horizontally layered systems each layer has access
to sensing and acting, making a decomposition into subagents likely. In
vertically layered system, only the lowest layer senses, and only the highest
acts, making a multiagent decomposition unlikely.<br>
<br>
As a multiagent system, Sumpy is particularly simple in that there is almost
no communication between the subagents. Each is, of course, privy to sensing
initiated by the others, and Sleepy's action effects the others. Also, each
subagent sometimes suppresses the actions of the lower layers. One might
ask if Wanderer is truly autonomous if Compressor can suppress its actions.
A person in jail, or in an elevator, has lost some freedom of movement,
but is still autonomous. Environment may be expected to imposes limits on
an agent's actions.<br>
<br>
Going back to our topological analogy, we might call a system with no communication
between its subagents a discrete multiagent system. A multiagent system
in which each agent communicates with every other might be called fully
connected,. Thus multiagents systems can be classified according to the
possible communications paths through the system. We might also classify
such systems by their communications bandwidth.<br>
<br>
In addition to multiagent systems that can reasonably be viewed as constituting
a single agent, other multiagent system are better classified as societies
of agents. For example, when a collection of scheduling agents gather to
schedule a meeting between their users, they pursue a common goal and intelligent
group behavior emerges (see Kautz, Selman, and Coen 1994 for a similar situation.)
Yet, as a group, our definition of agent is not met in that persistence
is missing. When scheduling is complete, our agents disperse, perhaps never
to gather again in this same grouping. One could argue that the collection
of all such scheduling agents at a given site constitute a single agent.
To do so, the notions of sensing, acting, and having its own agenda would
have to be considerably stretched. As Russell and Norvig have reminded us,
the issue here is not truth or falsity, but what's useful in communicating
about agents.<br>
<br>
The notion of a society of agents leads to a caution. The term "agent"
as used by Minsky (1985) does not necessarily refer to an autonomous agent
as the term is used here. In the context of trying to explain intelligence,
Minsky speaks of "mental agents," saying "Each mental agent
by itself can only do some simple thing that needs no mind or thought at
all." I suspect that some, if not many, of his agents don't meet all
our criteria for autonomous agents.
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
An attempt has been made to capture the essence of agency in a formal definition,
which allows a clear distinction between a software agent and an arbitrary
program. The beginnings of a natural kinds taxonomy for autonomous agents
is proposed, as is further classification via collections of features. <br>
